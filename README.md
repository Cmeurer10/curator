Curator is a platform used to highlight text and share annotations with a group of peers.

Once invited to a course via email by an instructor, students will have access to an electronic version of class documents. They can annotate and highlight words or phrases and post comments which are accessible by their classmates.

This platform is meant to encourage discussion amongst classmates and support student learning by bringing students together and allowing questions to be answered without a student needing to scour the internet or other resources.
